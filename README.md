# bootstrap_test

This project was meant to train with the CSS framework Bootstrap.

## Rules

We were asked to code a perfect copy of each screen (responsive web design) with HTML & Bootstrap (no extra CSS allowed). 
It took me less than 2 hours to make it.

## Documentation

In the documentation's folder, you can see the pictures of the screens we were supposed to copy.
